Transfer Prediction Project
Welcome to the Transfer Prediction Project repository, created for the "Advanced Data Analysis Methods Laboratory" course project.

Overview
This repository contains four Jupyter Notebook files that detail the project workflow:

web_scraping.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates web scraping techniques used to collect a list of players who were transferred in previous years.
data_cleaning.ipynb: Here, the scraped data is processed and cleaned using the pandas library.
dataset_preparing.ipynb: This notebook combines the cleaned data with additional private datasets to create the final dataset for analysis.
EDA.ipynb: Explore the dataset with this notebook, which contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns.
Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict player transfers based on historical data. By leveraging web scraping, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis, we aim to prepare a comprehensive dataset for machine learning model training.

Repository Structure
web_scraping.ipynb: Scrapes transfer data from web sources.
data_cleaning.ipynb: Cleans and processes the scraped data.
dataset_preparing.ipynb: Combines cleaned data with private datasets.
EDA.ipynb: Explores and analyzes the prepared dataset.
How to Use
Feel free to explore each notebook to understand the project workflow and analysis steps. The notebooks are organized sequentially to guide you through the data collection, cleaning, integration, and exploration processes.

Dependencies
The project utilizes Python and popular libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.
